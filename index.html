            <summary>Formulating a Question</summary>
            <p>The I Ching can be used for guidance in three contexts: as a psychological tool, as an oracle which
                divines the future, or as a method to commune with spirits.
                You are free to use the I Ching and this website in any fashion you please; however, I (website creator)
                tend to view it as a psychological tool which creates interesting correspondences with the future by
                means of synchronicity.
                <br /><br />
                Below is a guide on formulating a question from "The Original I Ching Oracle Or, The Book of Changes"
                (2018, p.19) which assumes that the I Ching is being used as a psychological tool. In a psychological
                context, one would use the I Ching to receive images that can be interpreted for guidance in a manner
                similar to dream interpretation.
                Of course, it is not strictly necessary that these guidelines be followed, but I would assume that
                scholars who have translated the I Ching know better than I about how to ask it questions.
                <hr>
                <b>Formulating a Question to the Oracle</b>
                <br />
                1. Ask only questions that are emotionally significant for you. The emotional charge in your question is
                the energy that
                activates the archetypal images in the answer. Only then can they speak to you and cause a rearrangement
                of your view of
                the situation. A question asked out of simple curiosity rarely gets a meaningful answer: the psychic
                energy required for
                significantly processing the matter is simply not available.
                <br /><br />
                2. Divination is not meant to replace critical reflection and introspection. Interrogating the oracle is
                useful only
                after you have deeply examined the situation and yourself and out of this examination you have distilled
                an appropriate
                question.
                <br /><br />
                3. Avoid asking the Yijing [I Ching] what to do, and avoid asking questions that expect yes or no as an
                answer (e.g., is it right
                to do this? will this succeed?). The answer will consist of images, and it will say neither yes nor no:
                it will be up to
                you to decide for a yes or a no, based on the resonance that those images call up in you.
                <br /><br />
                4. Avoid alternatives (e.g., /should I do this or that?). If the question is formulated as an
                alternative, it is
                difficult to decide whether the images contained in your answer refer to “this” or to “that.” When you
                are faced with an
                alternative, make a tentative choice (maybe the choice that is closer to your heart or the one that
                awakens more energy
                in you) and “test” it with the Yijing (“what about doing this?”). The answer will usually indirectly
                illuminate also the
                other option. A typical formula we often used at Eranos is “give me an image of ...” (this situation,
                this choice, my
                attitude, etc.).
                <br /><br />
                5. Be as specific as possible. Do not be afraid to narrow your question down. The answer to a vast or
                general question
                is often difficult to interpret, because the images can be read in too many different ways. On the
                contrary, starting
                from a concrete and emotionally significant question, the answer of the oracle frequently expands to
                include larger
                issues in the consultant's life.

                <p>This website hosts an English translation of the I Ching (a.k.a. Yijing, Book of Changes, Classic of
                    Changes)
                    by
                    Richard Wilhelm and Cary F. Banes. Originally translated from Chinese to German by Richard
                    Wilhelm
                    in 1923, Wilhelm's translation was later translated into English by Cary F. Banes in 1950.
                    As of 2025, Wilhelm's
                    translation is over 100 years old. Thank you Richard Wilhelm for allowing the western world
                    access to
                    this ancient wisdom, and thank you Cary F. Banes for allowing the English-speaking world access
                    to it as well.

                <p>This website was created on a whim by a programmer named <a
                        href="https://github.com/ExtraJuiceMan">Dan</a>. I wanted both an aesthetically pleasing copy of
                    the I Ching and an online script to cast I Ching hexagrams with. The hexagram casting script found
                    on this website uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination#Four_coins">Four
                        Coin Method</a>, which yields identical probabilities as with the classic <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination#Yarrow_stalks">Yarrow Stalk Method</a>.
                    The hexagram random number generation uses the <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues">Crypto.getRandomValues()</a>
                    API with a fallback to <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">Math.random()</a>
                    if Crypto is unavailable. The website's stylesheet was created using a heavily modified version of
                    <a href="https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css">simple.css</a>. The hexagrams are drawn and animated using <a href="https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.js">SVG.js</a>.
                    No generative AI was used in the
                    creation of this website.
                </p>
                <p>After the idea for creating this website came to me, I consulted the I Ching on the action of
                    creating
                    it. I casted a hexagram and received <a href="#hexagram-29">Hexagram 29</a>,
                    Darkness: "<i>The Abysmal repeated, If you are sincere, you have success in your heart, And whatever
                        you do succeeds.</i>" Carl Jung happened to receive the same hexagram after asking about his action in
                    writing
                    <a href="http://www.cyjack.com/cognition/I%20CHING%20-%20Carl%20Gustav%20Jung.pdf">the foreword</a>
                    to Richard Wilhelm's I Ching translation. The oracle works in strange and unusual ways!
